The theme of the design image is fashion promotion, likely highlighting an affordable clothing deal. The visual features a stylish, oversized black cardigan with a white checkered pattern. The soft and cozy texture of the knitwear stands out against the modern, chic setting of a café interior. The overall style is casual yet trendy, appealing to contemporary fashion enthusiasts. The color scheme is dominated by black and white, exuding a classic and versatile look. The foreground text items are ['衣宽家', '限时78元抢', '100200斤请进']. Place the items carefully to avoid unbalance, overlap, and out-of-bounds. The layout should contain all the text items in given order, in which each item has a bounding box described as [left, top, right, bottom] (all the values are integer numbers). Return the result by filling in the initial JSON file while keeping the label of items unchanged and do not return any extra explaination. The initial JSON is defined as: {\"height\": 750, \"width\": 513, \"items\": [{\"label\": \"衣宽家\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"label\": \"限时78元抢\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"label\": \"100200斤请进\", \"bbox\": []}]}",
